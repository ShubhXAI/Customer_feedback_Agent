ðŸ™ŒAutomating the Customer Voice with an AI AgentðŸ™Œ

Excited to share my latest project: an AI agent that automates customer feedback! It closes the loop on customer experience by handling post-service follow-ups, ensuring every voice is heard without manual effort.

How it Works: The agent, built with LangChain and LangGraph, runs a simple but powerful workflow:

ðŸ“ž Call & Extract: Simulates a call to a customer, then intelligently extracts their core feedback from the conversation.
ðŸ˜Š Analyze & Log: It performs sentiment analysis on the feedback (Satisfied, Dissatisfied, etc.) and logs the transcript, feedback, and sentiment score into a database.

Next Steps ðŸš€ The architecture is ready for a real-world upgrade. The plan is to replace the call simulation with a telephony API like Twilio to create a fully autonomous system.
